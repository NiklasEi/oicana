= Intro

Oicana offers seamless PDF templating across multiple platforms. Define your templates in Typst, specify dynamic inputs, and generate high quality PDFs from any environment - whether it's a web browser, server application, or desktop software.

Oicana templates are created using the modern and open source typesetter #link("https://typst.app")[Typst].
