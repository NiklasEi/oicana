Oicana stands on the shoulders of giants.

A list of dependencies of the Oicana project with their licenses #link("https://github.com/oicana/oicana/blob/main/NOTICE")[can be found in the repository].

== Typst #emoji.heart.spark

The modern and open source typesetter that made Oicana possible.

Oicana is not affiliated with the company behind Typst, that said, they are constantly improving the project and deserve support for that!
If you would like to use their official Typst editor, but keep all data on your own infrastructure, #link("https://typst.app/pricing/")[there is an option to run it on-premises].

== Typst community projects

The development of Oicana and the creation of Oicana templates uses several open source tools from the Typst community. A few of them are:

- #link("https://github.com/sjfhsjfh/typship")[Typship] - for local development of Typst packages.
- #link("https://github.com/Enter-tainer/typstyle")[Typstyle] - formatting of Typst files.
- #link("https://github.com/typst-community/tytanic")[Tytanic] - snapshot tests for Typst packages.
