# Oicana for Python

*Generate PDFs in Python without a headless browser.*

Python teams generating PDFs usually pick between a headless browser, HTML-to-PDF engines that fight page breaks and fonts, or low-level libraries that turn every layout into code. The abandoned wkhtmltopdf still shows up in production stacks.

Oicana compiles PDFs in process through native bindings instead. You design documents as [Typst](https://typst.app/) templates, load them once at startup, and render them from JSON in single-digit milliseconds. No browser process, no per-document fees, no document data leaving your infrastructure.

> **Free for noncommercial use.** Commercial use is free for 30 days, then needs a [per-application subscription](https://oicana.com/#pricing) with unlimited seats.

## Installation

```bash
pip install oicana     # or: uv add oicana
```

Wheels are published for Linux, macOS, and Windows on Python 3.9 and newer.

## Quick start

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

from oicana import Template

template_bytes = Path("invoice-0.1.0.zip").read_bytes()

with Template(template_bytes) as template:
    pdf = template.export(
        json_inputs={"invoice": json.dumps({
            "number": "2026-001",
            "customer": "Acme GmbH",
            "total": "€1,190.00",
        })},
    )

Path("invoice.pdf").write_bytes(pdf)
```

`export` returns the PDF bytes. `export_png` and `export_svg` produce the other formats, and `Template.export_once` renders a one-off template without registering it. The `Template` context manager frees native resources on exit.

## What a template looks like

Templates are plain [Typst](https://typst.app/) projects. A `typst.toml` manifest names the entrypoint and declares the inputs your application passes in:

```toml
[package]
name = "invoice"
version = "0.1.0"
entrypoint = "main.typ"

[tool.oicana]
manifest_version = 1

[[tool.oicana.inputs]]
type = "json"
key = "invoice"
development = "invoice.json"
```

The entrypoint, `main.typ`, reads those inputs through the Oicana Typst package and lays out the document:

```typst
#import "@preview/oicana:0.2.0": setup

#let read-project-file(path) = read(path, encoding: none)
#let (input, oicana-image, oicana-config) = setup(read-project-file)

#set document(title: "Invoice", date: datetime.today())

= Invoice #input.invoice.number

Billed to: #input.invoice.customer

*Total: #input.invoice.total*
```

The `development` value lets the template preview with real data in any Typst editor. `oicana pack` turns the directory into `invoice-0.1.0.zip`, the archive every Oicana integration loads.

The [Oicana CLI](https://oicana.com/docs/cli/) does the packing, so a layout change ships as a new asset, not a code change.

## Running in a web service

Load the template once at startup and export per request; afterwards there is no file I/O on the hot path. The native calls release the GIL, so exports from several worker threads run in parallel.

Full type hints ship with the package, so `Template`, `CompilationMode`, `ExportFormat`, and the input types autocomplete and type-check.

## Why Oicana

- **Runs in your infrastructure**: PDFs are generated inside your own application. No data is sent to a third-party service.
- **Multi-platform**: the same template works in the browser, Node.js, C#, Java, Rust, Python, and PHP.
- **Powerful layouting**: templates have all of Typst, including its package ecosystem.
- **Performant**: a warmed up template renders a PDF in single-digit milliseconds.
- **AI and version control ready**: templates are text files. They live next to your code, and AI can help write them.
- **No proprietary format**: templates are plain Typst projects. The Typst compiler is open source.
