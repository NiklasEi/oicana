# Oicana
*Dynamic PDF Generation based on Typst*

https://oicana.com

Oicana offers seamless PDF templating across multiple platforms. Define your templates in Typst, specify dynamic inputs, and generate high quality PDFs from any environment - whether it's a web browser, server application, or desktop software.

> **Oicana is in Alpha! It is rough around the edges and has a limited number of integrations.**

This package can live-preview Oicana templates and compile them with given input in the browser.

## Open source example
